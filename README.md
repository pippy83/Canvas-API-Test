# Canvas-API-Test
Exploring the Canvas API

Feel free to expand upon this code to include new functionality. In its current state, it will create a dictionary of courses and their assigments and then save them as a json file. I recommend looking over the documentation from Instructure in order to better understand the canvas api.

We are currently working on getting the canvas api to display the assignment due date as well.
