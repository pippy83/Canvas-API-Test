# Canvas-API-Test
Exploring the Canvas API

Feel free to expand upon this code to include new functionality. In its current state, it will simply print out a list of courses and associated assignments. I recommend looking over the documentation from Instructure in order to better understand the canvas api.

A dictionary of courses and their corresponding assigments was attempted, however the format of the paginated list makes the creation of a dictionary difficult, however this would be the ideal format.
